# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the performance of the Prompt Manager application. The application currently shows signs of performance bottlenecks in areas such as bundle size, component rendering, API requests, and user experience. The optimization will focus on improving load times, reducing bundle size, enhancing component performance, and providing better user feedback during operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly, so that I can start using it without waiting for long loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 30%
2. WHEN the user visits any page THEN the First Contentful Paint (FCP) SHALL occur within 1.5 seconds
3. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN the page transition SHALL complete within 500ms
4. WHEN the application loads THEN unused JavaScript SHALL be eliminated through code splitting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth interactions with the prompt list, so that I can browse and manage prompts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prompt list renders THEN it SHALL use virtualization for lists with more than 50 items
2. WHEN the user scrolls through prompts THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth without frame drops
3. WHEN the user searches prompts THEN the search results SHALL update within 200ms
4. WHEN the user filters by tags THEN the filtering SHALL be debounced to prevent excessive re-renders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want efficient API requests, so that data loads quickly and doesn't waste bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes API requests THEN duplicate requests SHALL be prevented through caching
2. WHEN the user performs search operations THEN API calls SHALL be debounced to reduce server load
3. WHEN the application loads data THEN it SHALL implement request deduplication
4. WHEN the user navigates THEN background data prefetching SHALL be implemented for likely next actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimized images and assets, so that pages load faster and consume less bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be optimized using Next.js Image component with proper sizing
2. WHEN the application loads THEN images SHALL be lazy-loaded when not immediately visible
3. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) when supported
4. WHEN static assets load THEN they SHALL be compressed and cached appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive feedback during operations, so that I know the application is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs any action THEN loading states SHALL be displayed within 100ms
2. WHEN operations take longer than 2 seconds THEN progress indicators SHALL be shown
3. WHEN the user submits forms THEN optimistic updates SHALL be implemented where appropriate
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build output, so that the application deploys efficiently and performs well in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the build process SHALL implement tree shaking to remove unused code
2. WHEN the application builds THEN CSS SHALL be optimized and purged of unused styles
3. WHEN the application builds THEN JavaScript bundles SHALL be split appropriately for optimal caching
4. WHEN the application deploys THEN static assets SHALL have proper cache headers set

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want efficient memory usage, so that the application doesn't slow down my device or browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN all event listeners and subscriptions SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN the application runs THEN memory leaks SHALL be prevented through proper cleanup
3. WHEN large lists are displayed THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized through virtualization
4. WHEN the user navigates THEN unused components SHALL be garbage collected properly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work well on mobile devices, so that I can use it efficiently on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on mobile THEN touch interactions SHALL be optimized for performance
2. WHEN the user interacts on mobile THEN the application SHALL prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN the application runs on mobile THEN it SHALL use appropriate viewport settings
4. WHEN mobile users scroll THEN momentum scrolling SHALL be enabled for smooth experience
